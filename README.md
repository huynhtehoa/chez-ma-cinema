## User Stories

The following **required** functionalities are completed (this is a sample):

* [x] The user can see the top 20 "Currently Playing" movies on a page.
* [x] For each movie, the user can see the Movie Title, Year, Rating, and Poster.
* [x] The user can see this information clearly on devices of various screen sizes.
* [x] The user can see "more" movies by tapping a "See More" button at the bottom.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] The user can enter a term into a search box to filter the currently loaded movies by search term. E.g.; the user can type "mar" and the results are reduced to show "Captain Marvel".
* [x] The user can change the "source" from "Currently Playing" movies to "Top Rated" movies (or any other of the endpoints supplied by MovieDB).
* [x] Sort by Rating and Popularity (from Lowest to Highest and Vice Versa).
* [x] Have Year, Rating as a slider. Change the display dynamically when the slider is changed. You could use React Input Range package for this task.
